1> Clone this project in any eclipse, I used STS (Spring Tool Suite).

e.g. git clone https://github.com/naeemdavis/vending-machine.git

2> Then run maven "clean install"

3> Then run VendingMachineServiceTest as unit test.

  3.1 First few test are checking (PART-1)
  
       public Collection<Coin> getOptimalChangeFor(int pence)
	   
  3.2 Then three test are checking (PART-2)   
        
	  Public Collection<Coin> getChangeFor(int pence)
	 
4> Main services classes are 

     VendingMachineServiceImpl
         This class contains above two methods. You can also see reuse of code in one and other.

      CoinInventoryServiceImpl
         service is available for reading/updating property file (coin-inventory.properties)

5> Please also check additional classes such as ResultCode enum (for errors), Coin enum.
    How affectively these two can be used in Insufficient Coins exception and services layer.
	
6> Bonus.
    This vending machine service can be deployed on any tomcat and use as a service.
